## Running Your Application Through A Network Tunnel
If using cloudflared, you will run the following command, replace 3000 with your web server's port.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:{CLIENT_PORT}
Once you run this command, you will receive your publicly accessible network tunnel address from cloudflared.
```

Once you run this command, you will receive your publicly accessible network tunnel address from cloudflared.
**Example:**
```
Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):
https://funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com
```
In the Discord Developer Portal, update the Application URL mapping for / url to funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com to match your network tunnel address and save your changes.
